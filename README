XMulti

A universal content management system written in XSLT (OK, at the moment there is only blog functionality - but I'm working on adding more usage cases).

System requirements:
A browser with decent XSLT support:
Firefox 3.6 (earlier versions should work, but are not tested)
Opera 10.x (in some 9.x version it did not work (although Opera already claimed at this time to have proper XSLT support - so you should not believe the marketing bullsh*t) - you'll probably really need 10.x)
I am working on Internet Explorer 8 support (there are no plans to support older versions of Internet Explorer)

Browsers known not to work:
Safari 4.0
Chrome 4.0
since they both have no proper support of xsl:include (this is a well-known bug in Webkit based browsers). As soon as this bug is fixed I'll probably add support.
